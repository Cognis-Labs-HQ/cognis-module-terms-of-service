# Cognis external module template

**English** · [Deutsch](README.de.md) · [Bahasa Indonesia](README.id.md) · [日本語](README.ja.md)

An intentionally small, installable reference module that touches the **UI, API, database, CLI, capabilities, flows, localization, tests, and marketplace packaging** surfaces of Cognis. It is a learning aid—not a generator—and mirrors the external-module boundary established by Cognis PR #172 and the Jitsi Meet module.

## Start here

```sh
npm install
npm test
npm run check:manifest
```

Install the repository as a Cognis module source, review its permissions, enable it, then open `/showcase` or run `cognisctl module-template:list`.

## Architecture map

| Path            | Responsibility                                                                            | Key lesson                                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `manifest.json` | Identity, compatibility, capabilities, entrypoints, store metadata, immutable file hashes | UUIDs are dependencies; IDs are human-readable           |
| `bootstrap.js`  | Sole host integration point                                                               | Register through `ctx`; never import Cognis internals    |
| `routes.json`   | Up-front page access declaration                                                          | The host validates protected routes before activation    |
| `api/index.js`  | Authenticated HTTP boundary and orchestration                                             | Validate input and delegate persistence                  |
| `api/store.js`  | Portable database-executor commands and schema                                            | Never bind a module to a database driver                 |
| `api/ui.js`     | Static assets, SPA route, navigation                                                      | Host registration makes disable/uninstall cleanup scoped |
| `ui/`           | Browser entrypoint, styling, four locale bundles                                          | Set `ui.stringsBaseUrl`; use host routes/toasts          |
| `cli/index.js`  | `cognisctl` extension                                                                     | CLI calls the public API instead of bypassing it         |
| `docs/`         | Contributor deep dives                                                                    | Explain contracts and safe extension patterns            |
| `scripts/`      | Package integrity checks                                                                  | Every shipped file has a SHA-256 digest                  |

## Lifecycle and boundaries

1. Cognis validates `manifest.json`, component dependencies, capability requirements, routes, and file digests.
2. Enabling calls `bootstrapModule(ctx)`. The module registers UI/API contributions, publishes a capability, and extends a flow.
3. API handlers authenticate and validate. The store owns schema and persistence through `db:executor`.
4. UI and CLI consume the same HTTP API. Other components may consume `showcase:listItems` through `ctx`.
5. Scoped registrations are removed when disabled. Add and return an explicit disposer if you create timers, listeners, sockets, or other resources outside scoped registrations.
6. Uninstalling calls `uninstallModule(ctx, { deleteContent })`; the template deletes its database rows only when the administrator requests content deletion.

Cross-component behavior belongs in **capabilities** (a callable contract) or **flows** (ordered extension stages). Do not reach into Cognis, gateways, or sibling module source trees. Required component links in `requires` are UUIDs; runtime contracts belong in `requiresCapabilities`.

## Forking this template

1. Choose a stable readable ID and generate a new UUID once. Never reuse this template UUID in a published fork.
2. Rename package, command, API/static paths, DB table prefix, localization namespace, flow extension IDs, and capability keys.
3. Replace publisher/repository/support metadata and artwork.
4. Keep manifest/package/lock versions identical, and set `ui.stringsBaseUrl` in the manifest to the module’s locale bundle base URL.
5. Add only capabilities the module truly needs, and keep route access least-privileged.
6. Run `npm run manifest:hashes` last, then `npm run check` and `git diff --check`.

See [`docs/standard.en.md`](docs/standard.en.md) before implementing a production module; equivalent German, Indonesian, and Japanese references live beside it.

## Contributor quality checks

This template includes the same automated contributor guardrails used by the Jitsi Meet module: Prettier formatting, readability limits, external-module structural checks, documentation-template parity, and ambiguous-name checks.

```sh
npm install
npm run lint
npm test
npm run check:manifest
git diff --check
```

New contract documentation can start from the localized templates in `.github/DOCUMENTATION_TEMPLATE.<language>.md`. Keep all four template variants structurally synchronized.
